# crowdfunding_etl
This project consisted of extracting, transforming, and loading data which contained information related to tracking crowdfunded initiative projects. A campaign and contacts files were utilized in order to obtain the appropriate information needed for the analysis and cleaned to a useable and appropriate state using Python/Pandas via Jupyter Notebook. The extracted and minimized files were imported into created tables within a SQL database for further querying and analysis purposes. Some resources utilized in this project included class resources from the University of California Berkeley Data Analytics Program and Stack Overflow for error troubleshooting purposes.
